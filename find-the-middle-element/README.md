Find middle element:
Problem Domain: An array of integers we need to create a function that returns the index of the element that is in the middle. So [3,5,2] we would want to return 3.

Working with Ben, we whiteboarded how we thought through the process. We went with a if else. Just going through each element one at a time seeing which element was the biggest and smallest in an array doing > tests. Eventually it would see which element should be in the middle and return that value.
