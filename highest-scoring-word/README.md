Highest Scoring Word:
Problem Domain: We have a string of words and we need to determine which word has the highest score. The score is based on each letter in the word having an integer value (a=1, b=2, c=3 etc) and then we return whichever word from the array has the highest score.

Working with Craig, we whiteboarded the problem and started from there. It was a lot of googling but we just took it piece by piece and worked through each step going from splitting the words into strings, giving each letter a score based on it's place in the alphabet, and comparing each word so that the highest scored word is the one it returns.
