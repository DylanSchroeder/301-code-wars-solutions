Working with Marc, we whiteboarded our problem domain. Then, based on the whiteboard solution we knew we would need a for loop. We knew, from Tuesday that we would use a modulus to determine even vs odd numbers. Next we would tell it whether or not the letter would be lower or uppercase using charAt(). Finally we return the string.
